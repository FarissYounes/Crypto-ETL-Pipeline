# Crypto-ETL-Pipeline
This project implements a complete ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that collects cryptocurrency market data from the public CoinGecko API. The data (price, market cap, 24h variation, etc.) is cleaned and stored in a DuckDB database. A Streamlit dashboard then provides an interactive view of key market trends in real time.
